#Headstart 

MVRT Headstart is a summer camp created to build a strong foundation in the basics of robotics for potential members. MVRT Headstart accomplishes this by training new students in the basics of electrical engineering, mechanical engineering, and computer science as related to FIRST Robotics Competition. The camp is a one-week summer camp where students receive a hands-on introduction to circuitry, mechanical and electrical tools, as well as programming in WPILib. Students also assemble a kit of parts to understand how the different divisions interact to create a finalized product. By participating in MVRT Headstart, students are provided with knowledge that will strengthen their understanding of robotics and ultimately create.
