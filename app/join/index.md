# Team Overview
The Monta Vista Robotics Team competes in the annual FIRST Robotics Competition, with the goal of inspiring high school students to become more excited about STEM and pursue careers in engineering. Every year, students (with support from professional engineers) also have the opportunity to design, manufacture, and program 120lb robots to participate in the annual FRC challenge, with constraints of both time and resources, allowing them to truly experience real-world engineering.

### Finances
MVRT runs on an annual budget of $50,000, and $70,000 in years when we attend the Championships. This includes $9,000 for FIRST and tournament registrations ($14,000 including Champs), and additional costs for parts, travel, tools and supplies. Although grants and sponsorships subsidize significant amounts of these expenses, we ask for a tax-deductible donation of $135 for the year. If a student wishes to become a member of MVRT and cannot afford part or all of the requested membership donation, scholarships are available. Please contact the team president at president@mvrt.com, or one of the mentors. Checks can be made out to “MV ASB”, with “MVRT” in the memo.
