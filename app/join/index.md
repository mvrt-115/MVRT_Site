There are five steps to become a member of MVRT. All five steps are mandatory
in order to join the team. The deadline for completing all parts is September
29, the day of our second team meeting.

1. Fill out the online application available [here][1].
2. Pay the $135 membership donation (or $160 with a polo). Polos will have the MVRT
   logo on one side, and your name embroidered on the other side. If you have
   any personal financial issues with paying the membership fee, please talk to
   us! We are more than willing to accommodate to your situation and we donâ€™t
   want money to be a reason for your not joining.
3. Print out, complete, and sign the MVRT application available [here][2].
4. Print out, complete, and sign the MVRT Charter available [here][3].
5. Print out, complete, and sign the MVRT Medical Form available [here][4].
