                <p>Hi everyone!
                        <br><br>
                        There are five steps to become a member of MVRT. All five steps are mandatory in order to join the team. The deadline for completing all parts is September 29, the day of our second team meeting.
                        <br><br>
                        1. Fill out the online application available <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1BYlaOZKRgOdW1QTL3t4crsZc0JCSsuffwD_TbLAHSmM/viewform">here</a>.
                        <br><br>
                        2. Pay the $135 membership fee (or $160 with a polo). Polos will have the MVRT logo on one side, and your name embroidered on the other side. If you have any personal financial issues with paying the membership fee, please talk to us! We are more than willing to accommodate to your situation and we don’t want money to be a reason for your not joining.
