According to Dean Kamen, founder of FIRST, FIRST wishes “to transform our culture by creating a world where science and technology are celebrated and where young people dream of becoming science and technology leaders." In order to follow FIRST’s vision, all participating teams are encouraged to instill an appreciation of the real-life rewards and career opportunities to others within their supportive community. 
<h2> Mentoring Other Teams </h2>

MVRT provides help to teams around the community, in state, and out of country. We provide help by keeping in contact with teams with email and video chats.

<h3>Mexico</h3>
After being contacted by a rookie FRC team in Mexico, our team has been providing them with support ever since. FIRST Team #115 has been helping FIRST Team #3943 through support in various different areas, including registration, competitions, and build. Because of these situations, we decided to make a complete manual of how our team functions for easy access to all of the FIRST teams, called the FIRST Aid Kit--which is easily accessible through our award-winning website.
<br></br>
<h3>Kickoff</h3>
MVRT hosts its own annual Kickoff every year for its members and local teams. Aside from playing the Kickoff video streamed on NASA’s website, MVRT adds its own twist to the Kickoff event by inviting experienced alumni as guest speakers to have Q&A sessions to clarify game rules, provide advice for the upcoming build season, and teach members how to manage their time wisely.
<img src="/img/outreach/kickoff.jpg"> In addition, local Councilman Sinks, and EmpowerKids Foundation CEO, Vivek Kumar, spoke during kickoff about their organization and FIRST. MVRT also provided refreshments and facilities for guest teams who wished to stay and begin brainstorming for the game. In 2012, MVRT’s Kickoff event hosted 8 additional teams (a record number of teams hosted) for an audience of over two hundred.</img>

<h2>BAE Toys for Tots</h2>
Monta Vista Robotics Team, along with other FIRST teams, provided the primary volunteer force for BAE System’s Toys for Tots event. Thousands of people from underprivileged families came to benefit from this extraordinary event. Activities we volunteer for include picking out toys, running games, and preparing food. MVRT also demoed our robot to promote STEM education and FIRST’s values to the underprivileged community.

<h2>ThinkFIRST</h2>
When the Cupertino Union School District issued the cancellation of the G.A.T.E. program in 2005, the Monta Vista Robotics Team stepped in and provided the community with free STEM education. The Monta Vista Robotics Team provides weekly classes at numerous elementary and middle schools around Silicon Valley taught by MVRT members.  The program was founded in 2006 and has grown to have over 650 students participate in the program.

<h2>FIRST Lego League</h2>
MVRT aims to help the community within FIRST. Through our widespread FLL program, we
inspire children to pursue STEM fields. In the past four years, MVRT has formed over 25 FLL
teams and in the past two years, seven out of the ten teams we have coached have made it
to district championships. One of the teams we coached, the Kennedians even held a  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgurbO46PlU">world record</a> for the most number of points during the 2012-2013 Senior . MVRT helps these kids realize that FLL is not just about winning but that it’s about working as a team.

<h2>Girls in STEM</h2>
<h3>US FIRST Girls</h3>
Our team has helped out with this organization by hosting the US FIRST Girls section at the Silicon Valley Regional in 2010. We helped out by making US FIRST Girls buttons and promoting the organization to others in our pit area. 
<h3>Google Speaker</h3>
Our team hosted a employee from Google to talk about engineering in google where many of the female students in our high school came to listen. 
<h3>Technovation</h3>
MVRT demoed at the girls only engineering camp to demonstrate the different sides to engineering and inspire. This took off and we are currently in partnership with them by supporting their organization and by inviting them to utilize our facilities for meetings.

<h2>International Student Demo</h2>
The International Exchange Student demo was an event that allowed an international group of students come to Cupertino as part of a touristic program. MVRT coordinated a time and date where the exchanging students from Taiwan could learn about our club, as well as partake in the enjoyment of driving our robot. In the planning of this event, MVRT simply sought to expand its reputation as a gracious club, while binding the global community together. 
<br></br>
<h2>Ohana</h2>
<img src="/img/outreach/ohana.jpg">It was four years ago when MVRT students realized that special education students at Monta Vista were getting little to no exposure to STEM activities.  To address this problem, MVRT formed a partnership with the Ohana Club, a club at Monta Vista dedicated to providing special education students with as many skills as possible, to teach students STEM concepts in an interactive, hands-on way.  Throughout the years, our curriculum has evolved and improved based on both the Ohana Students and the Ohana officer team.  The program was founded in 2012 and has grown to have over 60 special education students participating in the program.  Check out some photos from previous Ohana Classes.

<h2>Headstart</h2>
MVRT Headstart is a summer camp created to build a strong foundation in the basics of robotics for potential members. MVRT Headstart accomplishes this by training new students in the basics of electrical engineering, mechanical engineering, and computer science as related to FIRST Robotics Competition.
<img src="/img/outreach/headstart.jpg"> The camp is a one-week summer camp where students receive a hands-on introduction to circuitry, mechanical and electrical tools, as well as programming in WPILib. Students also assemble a kit of parts to understand how the different divisions interact to create a finalized product. By participating in MVRT Headstart, students are provided with knowledge that will strengthen their understanding of robotics and ultimately create. </img>

<h2>Kennedy Middle School Demo</h2>
This is an annual event at Kennedy Middle School which celebrates the graduation of the 8th graders. The point of this event is to showcase our robot and provide entertainment for the graduation party. Unintentionally we end up attracting the graduating 8th graders that were leaving KMS, and entering MVHS. 
<br></br>
<h2>Hot San Jose Nights (HSJN) STEAM Festival</h2>
<img src="/img/outreach/steam.jpg">The Hot San Jose Nights STEAM Festival is a yearly event that takes place in the Reid Hillview Airport. It is an opportunity for spreading Science, Technology, Engineering, Aviation, and Mathematics to our community. Several robotics teams show up to showcase their robot as well as their team. Others show up with vintage cars, military tanks, as well as rc airplanes to showcase. This event allows us to enhance our relationship with our community and spread the ideas of FIRST, while diversifying our presence to a recreationally participating crowd.The Hot San Jose STEAM Festival has been been conducted annually for the past 8 years. We have been participating the event for the past 2 years.

<h2>Isha Vidya</h2>
We wanted to donate a large amount of old books an organization in India called Isha Vidya. Isha Vidya is an organization which uses the textbooks to run schools and raise money for kids in rural India so they can receive a higher level of education than they previously would have received. The problem was that shipping the books to India was too expensive because of the weight of the books. Instead, we worked around it by sending them a check directly. We couldn’t help the children by sending them books, so we thought of a way around the problem.
