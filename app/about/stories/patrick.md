Reflecting back on the 8 years since I first stepped foot into the Monta Vista
Robotics Team lab, I still am awestruck by the power of a FIRST Robotics
experience. I look back into the mind's eye, and looked at myself, back then, a
15-year-old kid, and nothing more. There was nothing interesting about this kid.
He went through elementary school, middle school, and basically did what kids
do. He went to school, played handball, then moved onto Magic Cards, joined the
band, and if anyone were to look at this kid they'd say he'd grow up and do what
people do when they grew up.

Then, one January day in the first week of the new millennium, things changed. I
didn't realize it then, or even years from then, but by good fortune, this
ordinary kid was thrust into a proverbial hero's journey. We've all heard this
story before, in old books, in comics, in movies. An unassuming boy is thrust,
usually without his knowledge, into an epic adventure that he could not have
possibly imagined.

## That Kickoff day, on January 8th, 2000, my life changed.

In the first two years as a rookie member, I was put through the steepest
learning curve I'd experienced in my life. One could describe the experience
through the words, Physics, Prototyping, TIG welding, SAE screws, replacing a
dead drive train component on the robot between matches in 15 minutes.

## This was Passion.

In the third year, as team President, I was put through the steepest learning
curve I'd experienced in my life. Being at the helm of a prestigious
organization, I thought that the waters would be smooth sailing. In that moment,
the naive 17 year old had no idea of the storm to come. The storm would involve
months of bitter infighting among the core officer team. The words, politics,
backstabbing, hidden action, subversion, stonewalling, factions, and divided
vision come to mind.

We did not end the year without casualties, yet the team weathered the storm.
And the rookie captain, vowed to himself to rebuild a great team.

## This was Determination.

In my fourth year, as a veteran team President, we faced new challenges. Not the
least of which was the renovation of Monta Vista High School that had
essentially left the Robotics Team homeless. In that year, I remember talking to
my parents and convincing them to open up our home, our garage to host MVRT. It
was small, it was humble, it lacked the machine tools that we had grown so
accustomed to, but it did have one magical component, A Team. That team
surpassed all challenges and became for once the Silicon Valley Regional
Champions.

## This was Victory.

The boy, once ordinary, became a man with character.

And I return to the team, year after year, inviting the next set of ordinary
14–15 year olds to take the first step of an epic journey.

## This is FIRST.

Welcome Aboard, Tomorrow's Heroes
