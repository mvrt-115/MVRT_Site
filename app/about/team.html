                  Team 115 has been competing in the <i>FIRST</i> Robotics Competition for going on 18 years, starting with
                  the 1997 FRC game. We have competed in the annual Silicon Valley Regional and taken the honors at
                  this regional and various other competitions. MVRT has attended the <i>FIRST</i> Championships in St. Louis
                  almost every other year.<br><br>In addition, MVRT connects with the community through various outreach
                  activities including but not limited to FLL, ThinkFIRST, and Eduspire.</p>

                  <h4>Who We Are</h4>
                  <p>In 1997, MVRT 115 was founded by eager and enthusiastic students interested in FIRST and its mission. One of
                    the early "first generation teams," MVRT has stood strong for over 15 years as one of the 5000 FRC teams worldwide.
                    MVRT is made up and run by students attending Monta Vista High School.
                </blockquote>
                <h3><em>Our Mission<em></h3>
                <p>Dedicated to fostering a passion in science and technology within our community, the Monta Vista Robotics Team
                  inspires students and develops interpersonal skills through team-based engineering challenges.</p>
                <br>
                <b>Important things to remember</b>
                <li>Students work for 6 weeks on designing and building a robot to take to, and compete in, regional and
                  international competitions</li>
                <li>Volunteers and mentors from across the community teach and help students with the intensive design
                  process and build season</li>
                <li>MVRT meetings are  <u>not</u>  mandatory, but it is important to remember that members who put in more to the team
                  will learn more and have greater opportunity to participate in team activities</li>
