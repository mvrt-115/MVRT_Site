## What is <i class="first">FIRST</i>?


Founded in 1989, <i class="first">FIRST</i> (For Inspiration and Recognition in
Science and Technology) prides itself on its leadership in the scientific arena
and its commitment to building a strong foundation for the country’s future
workforce. Founder Dean Kamen, the recipient of the 2000 National Medal of
Technology, has “awakened the innovative and imaginative leadership in America’s
youth to the excitement of science and technology.” <i class="first">FIRST</i>
has competitions for several different age groups, from JFLL (Junior <i
class="first">FIRST</i> LEGO League) for elementary school students, FLL (<i
class="first">FIRST</i> LEGO League) for middle school students, to FRC (<i
class="first">FIRST</i> Robotics Competition) and FTC (<i
class="first">FIRST</i> Tech Challenge) for high school students.


## <i class="first">FIRST</i> Robotics Competition (FRC)

One of <i class="first">FIRST</i>’s main goals is promoting scientific
innovation through the annual <i class="first">FIRST</i> Robotics
Competition (FRC), designed to immerse high school students in real-life
engineering in the spirit of “Gracious Professionalism” to others. <i
class="first">FIRST</i> has experienced exponential growth since its
creation, and amazing success, as indicated by the hundreds of colleges
offering scholarships to team members and the dozens of media networks that
publicize the organization and its achievements.

Each year <i class="first">FIRST</i> develops the competition by supplying an
objective to teams of students, who have six weeks to conceptualize, design,
build, and test their robotic solution. Each year the objective is different;
details are kept secret until early January, when they are simultaneously
revealed to all teams during the Kick-Off.

Once the six weeks have passed, robots are transported to the competition site
where teams will compete in March. Teams go head-to-head in a series of
two-minute qualification and elimination rounds during a three-day competition.
This format requires that teams strategize and build into their design both
offensively and defensively. The robot that scores the most points during the
two minutes wins each round, and the one that earns the most points in these
rounds is declared champion.


## <i class="first">FIRST</i> Values

<i class="first">FIRST</i> strives to teach not just engineering skills, but
also life skills. <i class="first">FIRST</i> pushes for teams to exemplify
gracious professionalism and coopertition.

Gracious professionalism is “the way of doing things that encourages
high-quality work, emphasizes the values of others, and respects individuals and
the community.” <i class="first">FIRST</i> teams can demonstrate this ideal by
promoting good sportsmanship and maintaining the integrity of our members and
team. While teams are happy to receive awards and do well in competitions, teams
never put other down.

Coopertition, a theme that’s especially prevalent in competitions, is “to
display unqualified kindness and respect for other teams, even in the face of
fierce competition.” <i class="first">FIRST</i> teams cooperate with others even
while competing, so teams can teach each other, promoting mutual learning.
