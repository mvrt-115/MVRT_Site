Founded in 1997, the Monta Vista Robotics FIRST Team #115 was established
by a few friends looking for a way to adventure into the the technological
world through creative innovation.

Over the last seventeen years, MVRT has taken great strides in technology
and leadership by encouraging its members to further pursue their
imaginations beyond the mundane world and into the extraordinary realm.
However, none of the achievements and advancements in technology would have
been gained without the continuous and unfailing support of our community,
parents, and the more than valuable guidance of our advisors and alumni.
They have assisted us in overcoming obstacles along the path for original
and unique ideas.

MVRT continues to fulfill its mission in creating the “visionaries of
tomorrow” today by participating in <i class="first">FIRST</i> and
inspiring young students through mentoring and community outreach. We stand
together as a diverse group of people ready to face hardships and
difficulties and combine our ingenuity to attain a common goal: building a
masterpiece and inspiring the next generation of engineers and leaders.
