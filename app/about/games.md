 Recyle Rush is played with two alliances consisting of 3 teams each. Teams 
score points by stacking totes on  scoring platforms and topping of the 
stacks with recycling bins. Teams must also dispose of liter in the form of
pool noodles by inserting them into the bins.

## Aerial Assist

<a href = "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oxp4dkMQ1Vo">Watch the animation.</a> Aerial Assist is played by two competing alliances of three robots each on a flat 27x54 foot field using large, two foot diameter excercize balls. The goal is to score points by getting the ball into the goals on the two ends of the field. There are two eleven foot wide "high" goals about seven feet off the ground which are about three feet tall. There are also two "low" goals that are small boxes on each alliance's side of the field. The high goals are worth more points than the low goals. The field also has a truss: a horizontal bar set 5 feet off of the ground in the center of the field.


## Ultimate Ascent

Each Alliance consists of three robots, and they compete to score as many discs into
their goals as they can during a two (2)-minute and fifteen (15)-second match.
The higher the goal in which the disc is scored, the more points the Alliance receives.

## Rebound Rumble

They compete to hang as many inflated plastic shapes (triangles, circles, and squares) on their grids as they can during a two minute and fifteen second match. The higher the teams hang their game pieces on their scoring grid, the more points their alliance receives. 

## Breakaway

## Overdrive

<a href = "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYnUDaEi1D8"> Watch the animation.</a> Overdrive is played on a 27' x 54' carpeted field, where two alliances with three teams each move around the track moving track balls. The alliance players, which are composed of drivers, a coach, and a robocoach, are located at the end of the field from where they control their robots. The robocoach uses the four function Infrared Board to control the robot during Hybrid mode, giving a signal the initiate a series of commands for the robot to complete. Robocoaches are located at the corners of the track. The robots start against their alliance wall.
