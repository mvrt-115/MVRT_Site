Information
-----------
The MVRT Talon SRX Breakout requires both surface mount and through hole soldering. The exact components are linked in the open source files below, because the entire board is 100% open source. The board comes with the 12-pin header to attach to the Talon SRX. MVRT _highly_ recommends that you place electrical tape on the bottom of the board to pevent shorts.
