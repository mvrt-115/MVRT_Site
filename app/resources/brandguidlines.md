# Brand Guidlines

## Vision
MVRT’s primary goal is to be a positively impacting club in every way we can be. As a whole, we strive to be a student body which participates in improving the world as it passes while also participating in FRC on the side. Of course FRC, and FIRST as a whole are the medium with which we want to spread this love for improvement, but every single MVRT member should, and will, choose the ethically improving path as opposed to a victorious one. 

## Context
The following guidelines are chosen for specific scenarios. If one encounters themselves in a situation where what the guidelines entail doesn’t fit, then contact the current Marketing Director, VP of Ops, or President and consult them directly regarding the subject. While doing and functioning outside the guidelines please be mindful the vision. 

Note from the author:
If one would like to employ the following in a thorough manner, please take note of the way every sentence is worded, every term is printed or written, ever spacing, every subsection. I will do my best to not only translate the vision I have for MVRT, but the way I chose to convey it with everything I type. To those who took the time to read this, thank you for your patience.

-Benjamin Danek  

## Colors
For the most part, people will see the MVRT colors before any logos or designs. Following a consistent color pattern is more valuable than following a consistent logo pattern. For the majority of documents (entailing logs, fliers, brochures, ect.) please use a choice of the following colors. There is a range to accommodate printing services, but when given the opportunity please select

###Primary Colors:

Purple:

+ C122E0
+ A479A8
+ 9D5BB3
+ 7F58E5
+ 7E1294
+ 6E159E
+ 974AC1
+ 662D91 

Yellow:

+ FAF202
+ F0F067
+ FFF362
+ E6F745
+ FCFC28
+ F4FF06
+ F9E44E
+ FBB03B
+ FFD53B 

White:

+ FEF7FF
+ F3F5CE
+ FAFAF7
+ F5F5F0
+ F9EDFA
+ FFFFFF
+ F8F1FF

## Texts

### General
The standard text for documents (internally) is irrelevant, but any published documents either to parents, or the FIRST community should follow these guidelines thoroughly. 

### Fonts
Formal documents, or info pages that are intended to contain larger amounts of information should be written in Helvetica Neue.

### Emphasis Through Text
In the case that we would like to highlight information (in the way I have just shown) we would use the color [#8942f4] against a white background. 

In the case that you would like to make a “Note:” then go ahead and use the body format, and simply select the text color as [#b7b7b7]

## Robot
The purpose of this is to ensure that our robot has some sort of uniform image–we have a naming taxonomy that nobody really departs from, but seldom do we employ a constant robot image. This is partially due to the fact build is crazy, but the way a robot looks, powder coated and whatnot, is what casual bystanders at competitions really see. I think it is valuable to have an aesthetic robot, but I know it is expensive in so many ways.

### Powdercoat
We usually won’t have time, but if viable we should do a purple and gold powdercoat (take a combination of the primary and secondary colors that is available. Ask the current officers; Mechanical Director for schedule and design fit, Finance Director for budgeting awareness). If finances don’t work out, possibly do only the Purple powder coat and use the natural color of the remaining parts as a compliment. Aluminum silver and Purple go fairly well together anyways. The parts selected for powder coating should be consulted with the Engineering team more thoroughly. 

### Bumpers
Standard bumper construction (whatever is most efficient in regards to time, budget constraints and effectiveness). Include MVRT’s number centered on the bumper, whatever iron on font is viable, and whatever size fits the bumpers best. 2 mm spaces should be between the top and bottoms of the bumpers. 
Please consult the game manual in this case: make sure it fits the rules before it fits the guidelines. 

### Sponsors on the Robot 
Every sponsor should be represented on our robot in some way. In the case that we have 5 or fewer sponsors represent them with their logo, and some clear text based identification. In the case that we have more than that, simply use their most current logo. In the case that we have too many sponsors for a separate panel with their logos, simply cite all of their names in text, and in a reasonable size. For the last scenario, make sure the sponsor names could be read if the robot were to be next to you. 
For all of the scenarios, use a combination of the primary and secondary colors. Background should be Purple (primary), logos should be changed from their official colors to a yellow color scheme outlined in black. See 2015 - 2016’s robot’s panel as an example. 

## Media
The social media guidelines are more fluid than the other sections because of how quickly it reforms. In lieu of the ever changing social context and environment is important to keep a few things in mind when making social media posts. 

+ Never ever post at another team’s or person’s expense

+ In the case that you are making a post to notify a body of people about an event, please do so in a timely manner

+ Ideally, there will be posts leading up to the date (ex. “2 weeks until kickoff”, “1 week until kickoff”, “3 days until kickoff”, “1 day until kickoff” ect. The point of this is to make sure that people can fit the events we host into their schedules, ultimately giving us a better turnout.

+ Take into account the basic 4 points of infe (who...should attend the event, what… is the event that you are inviting them to, when… is the event taking place, where… is the event taking place) Even though it may be obvious to you, it might not be to the target audience.

+ Keep a positive but mature attitude whenever making posts on behalf of MVRT. Remember, this is not a private account–when making a social media post you are speaking on behalf of 120+ members and 20 years worth of alumni. No pressure though.

+ When Replying to people’s comments please be aware of any stances you may be making on controversial topics. The social norms are constantly changing so be sure to pick your side wisely. (And don’t ask yourself “What would [President’s name] do?” Just message them and ask them. These things are important.)
