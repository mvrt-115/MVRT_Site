  <p>Having been an FRC team since 1997, MVRT's experience has helped us
    develop tips for what we believe are the keys to success in the FIRST
    Robotics Competition.  We have put together a collection of resources,
    including our popular <a href="/resources/firstaidkit/"><i>FIRST Aid
    Kit</i></a>, for the use of both members and other teams.</p>

  <p>Our <a href="/resources/documents/">documents</a> and <a
      href="/resources/trainings/">trainings</a> have helped us keep our team
    well organized and sustainable, as well as a handful of <a
      href="/resources/links/">helpful links</a>.</p>
