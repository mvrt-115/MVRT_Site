    Having been an FRC team since 1997, MVRT's experience
    has helped us develop tips for what we believe are
    the keys to success in the FIRST Robotics Competition.
    We have put together a collection of resources,
    including our popular <i>FIRST Aid Kit</i>, for the use
    of both members and other teams. Click on any of the links
    on the left to go through our vast repository of resources.
