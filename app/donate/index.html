  After a great competition in Utah, MVRT students woke up on Sunday to find that our robot trailer was no longer attached to our mentor’s truck. This trailer was completely full, ready to transport our robot, spare and replacement parts, tools, and full pit setup back to California. While MVRT leadership has been working with the police in Utah to locate the missing trailer, it’s likely that most, if not all, of what was taken will not be recovered. Although we’re devastated by the theft, we are determined to overcome this obstacle and compete again this season. MVRT is a family of strong and resilient students, with the support of our sponsors and our community we’re confident that we will recover in time for the Idaho Regional later this month.<br><br>
