Colleges, universities, corporations, and associations make almost $14 millions worth of scholarships available to students who participate in FIRST. These scholarships are available to those involved with either the FRC or FTC program.<br><br>

Some of these scholarships are only open to students who plan to pursue majors in STEM fields, while others are applicable for any major. Both high school juniors and seniors have scholarships available to them, so be sure to check these out.<br><br>
