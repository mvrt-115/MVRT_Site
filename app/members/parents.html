<p>Dear parents,<br><br>

The Monta Vista Robotics Team greatly values the opinion parents so we hold Design Reviews in
F108, where we will demonstrate our current designs for the new game challenge. We will been working hard on our designs, and would greatly appreciate your input on our work. Snacks and refreshments will be provided.<br><br>

MVRT could always use more help from parent volunteers and it is not a matter of whether they are engaged in the field of engineering or not. Parents can help us with things from animations to making food for members on late nights, even just supervising us would be extremely appreciated. It would also be nice if we can get sponsor support from parents' companies or donations because some of our sponsors actually matches it up. Below is a survey that we would like parents to fill up so MVRT can better organize parents' efforts in supporting us.
